However, I have also heard reference to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, which I gather is a different judicial body from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.\n\n\nI found [this page on the state government website about the SJC Clerk for Suffolk County](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/sjc-clerks-office-for-the-county-of-suffolk), but I'm not sure if that's the same thing either, and even if it is, the page does not describe the *function* of the SJC Clerk for Suffolk County, only the opening hours, COVID-19 restrictions, and contact information.\n\n\nSo what *is* the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, and how is it affiliated (if at all) to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts?",

Then also GPS signal was coming from the `B`'s home, and when she called the messenger, the ringtone come from `B`'s home (device was still connected to the WIFI).\n\n\nWhen she called a police, they couldnt do anything and said that they have wait for a court order (search warrant) and even it was dubious if they would get search warrant at all. After weeks, the search warrant was issued, but no need to guess any joke out of it, there was already no trace of existence of the item in thief's home.\n\n\nSimilar situations happened quite many times around me, people being robbed quickly, and police being unable to do anything, and all such cases closed without any success.\n\n\n1. Des the police act correctly?\n2. What should the owner do in such a case, when the owner still knows the item's location exactly and immediate action is needed, but the police is not helping?\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n(p.s.
